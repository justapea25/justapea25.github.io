                <h2>To Paradise by Hanya Yanagihara</h2>
                <p><b>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER • From the award-winning, best-selling author of the classic A Little Life—a bold,
                brilliant novel spanning three centuries and three different versions of the American experiment, about lovers, family,
                loss and the elusive promise of utopia.</b></p>
                
                <p>To Paradise is a fin de siècle novel of marvelous literary effect, but above all it is a work of emotional genius. The
                great power of this remarkable novel is driven by Yanagihara’s understanding of the aching desire to protect those we
                love—partners, lovers, children, friends, family, and even our fellow citizens—and the pain that ensues when we cannot.</p>
                
                <p>In an alternate version of 1893 America, New York is part of the Free States, where people may live and love whomever
                they please (or so it seems). The fragile young scion of a distinguished family resists betrothal to a worthy suitor,
                drawn to a charming music teacher of no means. In a 1993 Manhattan besieged by the AIDS epidemic, a young Hawaiian man
                lives with his much older, wealthier partner, hiding his troubled childhood and the fate of his father. And in 2093, in
                a world riven by plagues and governed by totalitarian rule, a powerful scientist’s damaged granddaughter tries to
                navigate life without him—and solve the mystery of her husband’s disappearances.</p>
                
                <p>These three sections comprise an ingenious symphony, as recurring notes and themes deepen and enrich one another: A
                townhouse in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village; illness, and treatments that come at a terrible cost; wealth
                and squalor; the weak and the strong; race; the definition of family, and of nationhood; the dangerous righteousness of
                the powerful, and of revolutionaries; the longing to find a place in an earthly paradise, and the gradual realization
                that it can’t exist. What unites not just the characters, but these Americas, are their reckonings with the qualities
                that make us human: Fear. Love. Shame. Need. Loneliness.</p>
